# Liskov-Substitution-Principle
An example project that illustrates the adoption of the Liskov Substitution Principle.

The first commit contains two classes (CicleLiskov and SquareLiskov) that are implemented according to the Liskov Substitution Principal and one class that doesn't (LineNotLiskov). The subsequent commits should include the correct implementation of the Liskov Substitution Principal. This principal states that the subclasses should implement all the functionality of the superclass.
